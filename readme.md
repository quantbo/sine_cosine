#sine and cosine functions

This exercise tackles a few objectives:

* Graph data that can be negative, zero, and positive in its domain and range. This involves a somewhat subtle distinction between chart axes and mathematical axes. To elaborate:
<p>The x axis of a chart is normally at the bottom of the chart and the y axis is at left hand side or right hand side of the chart. However, to portray data that can be negative, zero, or positive typically requires drawing mathematical axes as well; that is, axes that pass through zero horiztonally and vertically.</p>
* Generate a chart x axis that is expressed in units of PI. This is not trivial and involves coding a formatting function that converts the data to labels exhibiting the greek letter PI.
* Generate a legend. A legend that is poorly designed or poorly placed can stick out like a sore thumb. I provide a legend that aims to be informative but understated.
* Shade the areas between the curves and the mathematical x axis.
