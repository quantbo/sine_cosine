Graph sine and cosine functions. Shade the areas between the graphs and the x-axis.
This exercise focuses on the following objectives:
* Shading.
* Plotting graphs that can be negative, zero, and positive in their domains and ranges.
* Generating an x-axis that is expressed in units of PI.
* Generating a legend. It might not be obvious to someone who has not recently brushed up on their high school math which curve is the sine and which the cosine.
